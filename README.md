## Description of Project
In this exercise, a Tic-Tac-Toe game was create to implement and practice using parent and child functions/relationships for JSX. A React App was created to interact and play the classic game.

## How To Run
Open a browser window and load the index.html file.
The gameboard should appear on the screen.
Begin clicking on the board to play.

## Roadmap for Updates
For an updated feature, I would like to allow a "computer" to play against the individual. If you don't have a second player, then you can play against the program. In order to implement this, you would need to create a secondary player that would have a randomized selection for its turns. 
A second update that I would like to implement is a reset/"It's a Draw!" feature. If the game ends in a draw, you would be given the option to reset the game board and start a new game.
